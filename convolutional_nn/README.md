# Convolutional Neural Network

To create a new architecture create a json files with the details and place it in the models folder. You can look at the avalailable models to see the details.

## Training

To train the network, specify your modelname in bohemianet_train.py and run the program.

## Evaluating

To evaluate the accuracy of the model, specify your modelname in bohemianet_eval.py and run the program.

## Testing

To run your model on the testing data, specify your modelname in bohemianet_test.py and run the program. This will generate a file 'predictions.csv' with your predicted classes.
